Current - First derivative of charge. (d/dt)q(t) = (d/dt)Q = dQ/dt
q or Q = charge
For the electron, q = -1.6e-19 coul.

I = Amp = Coul/Sec

WORK EXAMPLE 1.1 (P.9) EXERCISE 1.1, 1.2 (P.11)

UPPERCASE - Constant
lowercase - !Constant

V = Volt = Joule/Coul

Voltage = "Potential Energy"

Height = "Potential Energy"

DC - Direct Current - current "flows" in one direction FLUID FLOW approx.
AC - Alternating Current - current flows "back and forth"
