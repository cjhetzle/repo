state diagrams - keep track of the various different states your program goes through. FSM
design metrics -
    basic code metrics - lines of code; number of classes;
    complexity = cyclomatic complexity; number of methods;
    cohesion -
    coupling - measure of interdependence between two objects;
    encapsulation - all that is seen of an object is its interface;
    inheritance - number of children;
secure design - IEEE principles of secure design
    SQL injection - attacker sends text-based attack to exploit the interpreter;
patterns -
    strategy pattern - uses the best algorithm for a scenario; it is not hard coded
    observer pattern - multiple observers tracking changes from a single source
    composite pattern - objects can have fields in it that are other objects
    MVC - model is your data; view with what the users sees; controller is how the data is manipulated
    behavioral design pattern -
    structural design pattern - how things will be linked
    creational design pattern -
testing -
    unit testing - testing that tests if a specific method works
    integration testing - makes sure that larger components of code work well together
    system testing - makes sure that the entire system works properly
    boundary testing
    equivalence testing
processes and practices -
    individual review - each inspector looks over without help
corrective maintenance - fixing bugs on your system;
adaptive maintenance - this should be able to run on a phone; a new environment
perfective maintenance - after it becomes an issue?;
preventative maintenance - dealing with something before it becomes an issue;
